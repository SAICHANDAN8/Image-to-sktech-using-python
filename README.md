Image to Pencil Sketch Conversion:
Image to pencil sketch conversion is a creative process that involves digitally transforming a photograph or image into a hand-drawn pencil-like representation. This technique is often used in art, design, and photography to add a unique and artistic touch to images. It aims to capture the essence of traditional pencil drawing, with its characteristic lines, shading, and textures.

Process:
The conversion process typically involves several steps:

    Edge Detection: The first step is to identify the edges and contours within the image. This helps in defining the main shapes and structures.

    Gradient Mapping: By mapping the gradients of the original image, different levels of shading are created. Darker areas in the original image are represented by denser pencil strokes, simulating shading and depth.

    Texture Enhancement: To mimic the texture of a real pencil drawing, variations in stroke thickness and direction can be introduced, adding a sense of authenticity to the sketch.

    Contrast and Details: Adjustments to contrast and details help in enhancing the overall sketch effect. These adjustments can accentuate highlights and shadows, making the sketch visually appealing.

    Final Touches: Adding finishing touches like simulated paper texture or slight imperfections can further enhance the illusion of a genuine hand-drawn sketch.
